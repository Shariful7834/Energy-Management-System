# Energy Management System

## Project Overview

The **Energy Management System** is a Java-based application designed to manage logs related to charging stations, energy sources, and the entire energy system. The system utilizes file I/O operations (create, move, delete, archive) and character streams to simulate data exchange. Regular expressions are used for searching and opening log files based on equipment name or date.

## Features

- Creation of log files for charging stations, energy sources, and the system.
- File operations: create, move, delete, archive.
- Searching logs using regular expressions.
- Displaying log file contents.

## Technologies Used

- **Java** for programming.
- **java.io** package for file I/O operations.
- **java.nio.file** for managing file paths and moving/deleting files.
- **java.util.regex** for regular expressions.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

   Navigate to the project directory:
